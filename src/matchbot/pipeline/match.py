"""Stage 4 — Match vs the rilds_reference identity reference.

Operates on the STAGE frame (each row already carries its integer ``id`` from
the stage insert). Builds a blocking index over ``rilds_reference``, runs each
staged record through the configured matcher chain, and produces three outputs:

* ``stage_updates`` — in-place updates to stage rows (idcol_id/score/status).
* ``target``        — matched rows (stage_id, idcol_id, score, method).
* ``error``         — unmatched / low-confidence rows (stage_id, decision, reason).

The first matcher to reach a terminal decision (MATCHED or AMBIGUOUS) wins. No
human gate: AMBIGUOUS -> LOW_CONFIDENCE in the error table for optional review.
