"""The per-run metrics accumulator.

Deliberately free of any DB or cloud dependency: it is a plain in-memory object
the orchestrator fills in, then hands to the repository for persistence and to
the logger for the summary line. The metrics requested for benchmarking the
three runtimes — wall-clock time, per-stage timings, and match rate — are all
first-class here, alongside per-hop row counts and DQ metrics.
