"""The orchestrator — runs the whole pipeline end to end, no manual steps.

For each provider file it: parses, maps to canonical, cleanses + DQ, matches,
writes TARGET/ERROR, persists the audit record, and notifies. Row counts and
timings are captured at every hop into :class:`RunMetrics`. Any stage failure is
caught, recorded as a FAILED audit row, logged, and (optionally) re-raised — the
run never silently half-completes.

The stage order is wired here; stages themselves know nothing of each other.
